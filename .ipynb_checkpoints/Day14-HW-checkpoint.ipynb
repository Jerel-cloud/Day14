    "Algorithms are very important, they are used in almost everything that we do that involves technology from navigating apps to being used in cars to control its speed and direction. While this is true, we can also acknowledge the harmful stereotypes and prejudices that can certain algorithms can be used to perpetuate these. For examples algorithms used in criminal sentencing to predict how likely one is to be a reoffender is negatively skewed in the way of black people being more likely to recommit those crimes than whites."

    "One way is to be empathetic and look at the bigger picture. Ask yourself whos being affected most by these decisions, in what way, and are we reinforcing harmful stereotypes in our decisions. If its a boss that trying to get you to do something that seems unethical, research on laws around the topic and present them to him or his superiors/authorities if need be. Having others Peer review your work to see if it crosses ethical boundaries is another solution as well."

    "The article in The Ethics of Managing People’s Data. This article goes over a wide range of topics in the realm of data science, from the emergence of A.I and the ethics concerning its usage to the ethics of dating scraping and how the laws around it may seem flimsy. \r\n",
    "The first article that I will be going over is The Ethics of Managing People’s Data written (by Michael Segalla and Dominique Rouziès). It mainly goes over how companies use Artificial Intelligence (A.I) or hope to use A.I to better process data, gaining competitive advantages against other companies. While this does sound to be an amazing opportunity, there's a problem posed on the ethical side of this subject. Unethical business practices such as racism, privacy violations and misuse of data are problems posed with these advances. Having someone or a group of people to oversee the technical side of these technological advancements is key for companies to avoid scandals, fines, lawsuits, and overall loss of trust from the public.\r\n",
    "The author introduced to me very interesting things such as an institutional review board (IRB) and a concept called the five P’s. An IRB is a group of individuals in a company who specialize in the legalities and ethics on the use of gathering of data. Ideally these boards are supposed to be staffed with “a compliance specialist, a data scientist, a business executive familiar with the functional area of the digital projects (such as human resources, marketing, or finance), and one or more senior professionals with appropriate academic credentials. ( (“The Ethics of Managing People's Data”))”. I agree that an IRB should consist of experts from diverse backgrounds in business and tech to more efficiently analyze situations.\r\n",
    " This article also goes in depth on how these scenarios should be studied. The five P’s are methods that highlight ways to efficiently and ethically gather, manage, and analyze data. The five P’s consist of Provenance: The first P being Provenance: guarantees that data is being gathered and sourced. Additionally, draw attention to the risks associated with illegal and improper sourcing, which can lead to consequences, legal and social consequences. Purpose: The original purpose of using the data conveyed with permission requested for new uses of said data. This is done to make sure trust isn’t lost. Protection: the use of good safeguards to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches. Privacy: Information used to identify someone made anonymous to protect their privacy. Preparation: When merging datasets, accuracy is guaranteed and risks are reduced through appropriate data cleansing, anonymization, and validation. I believe that all of these are key components to a solid system in which to make sure data is being used in an ethical way. \r\n",
    "By implementing frameworks such as the Five Ps and putting in place strong control mechanisms, businesses may prioritize ethical standards in data management. In addition to being required by law and morality, handling data ethically is also a competitive benefit for establishing credibility and guaranteeing long-term success.\r\n",
